          <div class="body-text"> As part of my study abroad coursework, I had the opportunity to create a video game in Unity. The game was made as a collaboration with students at the University of Kyoto with the goal of teaching players the importance of disaster preparedness during an Earthquake or Tsunami. At the end of the semester we demoed the game in front of faculty members from both Kyoto University and the University of Florida.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The game is split into two phases. During the first phase the player is notified about an incoming disaster and has a few seconds to gather items from their house before entering the platforming section, where the goal then becomes to make it to the end of the stage as fast as possible without dying. My role was focused on creating the scripts related to the powerups you'd received from the items you collect, alongside creating stage hazards scattered throughout the 2nd phase of the game. Near the end of development I was able to spend time creating sound effects and music for the game, alongside doing a lot of playtesting to ensure that everything was working as expected before the live demonstration.</div>
